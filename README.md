# Minesweeper
CS189 First Half Project. <br>
Goal: Create a functional and good-looking Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>
Disclaimer: I did not write the code from scratch, nor do I own any external images. <br><br>

This project (on Github) has been recorded and updated biweekly until mid-March. Right now, it is currently closed (though updates may come and go).
