# Minesweeper
CS189 First Half Project. <br>
Goal: Create a functional and good-looking Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>
Disclaimer: I did not write the code from scratch, nor do I own any external images. <br><br>

This project (on Github) will be recorded and updated biweekly until mid-March. However, because I put this project on Github on the fourth week, the versions will not be uploaded in order (though the content will reflect my progress).
