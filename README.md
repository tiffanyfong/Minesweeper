# Minesweeper

# No longer being updated regularly

CS189 First Half Project. <br>
Goal: Create a functional and good-looking Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>
Disclaimer: I did not write the code from scratch, nor do I own any external images. <br><br>

This is my first time using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a larger project. This has been updated biweekly from 1/26/2016 to 3/8/2016.

Play the final version! <br>
